Step 1 : Learn the basic of JS (no HTML and CSS)
Step 2 : Manipulate HTML/CSS

Basic : 
    - Primitive types (Number String Boolean Null Undefined Symbol BigInt)
    - Where we run our code (In Chrome developper tools console)
        Inspect > Console

Number : One type for all number !
    Positive, Negative, Integer, Decimal 
    Operator : +  -  *  /  %  ()  ** 
    NaN = Not a Number, Considered as a number but is not a number
        Ex : (0/0)  (1 + NaN)
        It's a special Value

typeof varname -> Give the type of the variable

Variable & Let : Store Value with a name
    Init : let varName = value;
    Update Val : varName = newValue; | varName += addVal; | varName ++

    const = Constant -> Does not change
    const PI = 3.14;

    var : Old way to create variable (Now there is no reason to use it anymore)
    var varName = 26.2;

Boolean : true or false
    Value : true | false
    
Variable Name Convention : 
    No Space, Doesn't start with digit
    Best Practices : camelCase = uneNouvelleVariable
    Use a nice name ! 


In JavaScript, value can change type. (Not like TypeScript)
