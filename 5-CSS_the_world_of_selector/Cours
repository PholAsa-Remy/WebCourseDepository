Rappel : a rule in CSS have this form : 
selector {
    propreties : values;
}

universal selector : (select everything, not recommended)
* {
    color: black;
}

element selector : (select a element)
h1,p {
    color: #0F5264;
}

Each id have to be unique in the HTML! Try to keep them at a minimum number if possible
id selector : (select an element with a certain id)
#name_id {
    background-color: #05A356;
}


class is the same as id, but multiple element can have the same class
Can group content together ! simply add the attribute class="" in the html
class selector : (select element that are in a certain class)
.name_class{
    text-align : center;
}

descendant selector :(here, select anchors that are descendant a descendant to li)
li a {
    color: teal;
}

adjacent selector : (select p that are imediatly after a h1)
h1 + p {
    color: red
}

direct child selector : (select li that are direct descendant of div)
div > li {
    color:white;
}

attribute selector :
input[type="text"]{
    width: 300px;
    color: yellow;
}

pseudo classes selector: :hover, :active, nth-of-type
a:hover{
    color:orange;
}
.name_class:nth-of-type(3n){
    background-color:grey;
}

pseudo elements selector: select a particular part of a selected elements
h2::first-letter{
    font-size:50px;
}
p::selection{
    color:#fc8b15;
}

Cascade: the order the rules are writter are important ! 
Specificity : When there is a conflict, the most specific rule wins.
Inline Style > ID > CLASS > Element


!important : Set somethings to be Hyper Specific (Not recommended !)
a {
    color:white !important;
}

Inheritance : the elements descendant will get the attribut
some elements doesn't inherit by default : 
button,input{
    color:inherit;
}
