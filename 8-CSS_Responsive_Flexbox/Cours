Flexbox : distribute space dynamically

Display : 
    display:flex 
    In flexbox, there are two axis :
        Main axis
        Cross axis

Flex Direction : Change the Main axis direction 
    flex-direction:row/row-reverse/column/column-reverse

Justify Content :how the content is distributed across the main axis
    flex-start -> default
    flex-end -> pile up to the end of the main axis
    center -> pile up to the center of the main axis
    space-between/space-around/space-evenly -> distribute the extra space between the element

Flex-Warp : Activate the warp of element alons the cross axis
    flex-warp : warp/warp-reverse/nowarp
    Warp in the Cross Axis

Align Items : Distribute space along the cross axis
    flex-start -> default
    flex-end -> pile up to the end of the cross axis
    center -> pile up to the center of the cross axis
    base-line -> align with the baseline of the text

Align Content : Distribute space betwenn MULTIPLE column
    applies only with wrap/warp-reverse
    align-content : flex-start/ flex-end/center/space-between/space-around/space-evenly

Align Self : Align to the element itself (not the container !)
    flex-start -> default
    flex-end -> pile up to the end of the main axis
    center -> pile up to the center of the main axis

---------------  Flex Sizing Propreties  ------------------------------
Flex-basis : define the initial width of an element before additional space is distributed (direction of the main axis)
    flex-basis : 400px; -> initial size is 400 px
Flex grow : The amount of space an element takes up if there's space (no unit!)
    flex-grow : 2; -> grow 2 times faster if there is space
Flex shrink : How much the element can shrink when there isn't enough space (no unit!)
    flex-shrink : 2; -> shrink 2 times faster if there not enough space
NB : min-width, min-height, max-width , max-height can be used to restraint the size

Raccourcis : Flex : Permets d'initier les 3 valeurs d'un coup

---------------  Responsive Design  -------------------------------------

Problem : We have now a lot of differents screen size.
Responsive : Create a single website that can adapt to differents screen size

Media queries : Change the style depending to some parameter (screen size, ...)
condition : min-width: 600px , orientation : landscape

@media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width : 800px) {
    h1 {
        color: purple;
    }
} -> when the page is bigger than 800px, the h1 turn purple
