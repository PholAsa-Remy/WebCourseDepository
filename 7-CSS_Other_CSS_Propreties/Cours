Opacity and Alpha Channel : Transparency 
there is a rgba, a = how see throws is the color
Alpha :
0 <= a <= 1
background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.7); (can be used with hexadecimal)
alpha propreties doesn't heritage to its descendant

Opacity :
0 <= opacity <= 1
Same as Alpha, but it affect his descendants.

Position :
set how a element is position in a document.
    position : static; -> default

    position : relative; -> keep the document in the flow of the documents
        top: 100px -> ofset the element of 100 px from its initial position
        the element is placed relative to his initial position

    position : absolute; -> Remove the space taken by the elements, remove the element from the flow
        top : 100px; -> it's relative to it's ancestor. if there was no ancestor, relative to the body.

    position : fixed; -> relative to the containing box (the body)
        used for menu bar;
    
    position : sticky -> In the document and then stick on the top

Transition :
    transition: 1s;
    proprety name | duration | timing function | delays
    transition: background-color 3s; -> transition only the background color
    transition: background-color 3s 1s; -> make a delay of 1sec before the transition start
    transition: background-color 1s, border-radius 1s;

    Timing function : transition-timing-function (MDN)
    ease-in, ease-out, cubic-bezier(...)

    Please single out the propreties for transition! No transition-all !

Transform : Like Photoshop transform tool
    there is a lot of function for transform
    margin-auto -> center the element in it's containers
    transform : rotate (45deg);
    transform-origin : bottom-right; -> move the origin

    transform: scale(3,2);

    transform: translateX(300px), translateY(-200%), translate(-200px,100px)

    transform: skew (30 deg); transform: skew (30 deg,5deg);

    We can combine transformation :
        transform: rotate(90deg) scale(1.3)
    
    Transform applies to all the descendants of the elements.

Background : 
    background-image : "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1620192488879-3209072d824a?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1534&q=80"
    background-size : contain (size the image without cropping)
    background-size : cover (size the image with cropping)
    background-position : bottom; (where the image start ?)
    background : the order doesn't matter here.
    BUT if we use bg-size, we have to put it directly after position!
    background: center/cover ...
    we can have multiple background ! 

Google fonts : we can include a font for a website! use it!
