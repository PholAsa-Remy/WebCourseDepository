WTF is Bootstrap:
FrameWork : Une base pour un projet, le squelette d'un projet.

2 mains things :
    Components : button, nav bars
    Grid system : Help layout the website

To get a particular button from Bootstrap, just do :
    - Include Bootstrap
    - Give the corresponding class

Grid system : 
    Help layout the website. Particular class with row and column (col)

How to include Bootstrap:
    - Download the full Bootstrap and link the css 
    - Use a CDN (hosted version of a style sheet)

Every Bootstrap element works with class

container : Contains and pads some content (some pads are here)
container-fluid : Container that goes to the full width
container-sm/container-md/container-lg/container-xl : use the container until a certain size.
We will always work in a container

Buttons (btn): the color of the buttons can be changed !
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
    [Primary secondary Danger ...] is for the semantics of the website
    There are a lot of variation of the button, check the docs for all of them !

Typography : 
    display (display-[1/2/3/4]) : give the header a certain size
    blockquote : (it's also html element) represent some quotation
        blockquote-footer : make a footer
    we can align text with [text-center, ...]
    text-[primary,secondary,...] -> change the color

Badges : Used for displaing count in a label 
    <span class="badge badge-success">
    btn-group : make a group of button

Alert : <div class="alert alert-[primary/secondary/warning/...]"> 

Grid System : Create Responsive Layout for a web page
    It only works in a container
    We need to create a row using the class "row"
    every row in Bootstrap have 12 unit to divide 
    in a row, we need to create colomn (col)
    If we need equals space, just use the class "col" without a number

Responsive Grid : 
    There are differents size predefined in bootstrap
    to specify those size use for exemple :
    col-sm-8 instead of col-8

Alignment : In bootstrap, we use the terminology of flexbox to align the items
    justify-content-center
    justify-content-lg-start
    align-items-end ...

Form : 
    Form control : place in the input itself
    
Navbar : 
    class : "navbar" 
    navbar-light / navbar-dark -> text of the navbar

    collapse : Collapse content
    navbar-expend-lg : show the collapsed content on lg screen
    navbar-toggler : The burger to show the collapsed content
        data-target : what to expand (the id)
        data-toggle="collapse"
        you must for making it work the javascript of Bootstrap
    fixed-top : stay on top
    sticky-top : stay on top after we scroll throws it

Bootstrap Icons : Free set of icons 
    SVG : vector drawing, information to make the icons
    Font-awesome website for icons
